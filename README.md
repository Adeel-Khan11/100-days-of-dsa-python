# 100 Days of DSA with Python

Welcome to my 100 Days of Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) Challenge!  
This repository documents my daily journey of solving DSA problems using Python, with problems mainly sourced from LeetCode.

---

##  Purpose

This challenge is more than just coding — it's about building a **strong foundation** in problem-solving that’s essential for:

- Cracking software engineering interviews
- Writing efficient, optimized code
- Understanding how data is structured and manipulated under the hood
- Strengthening logic and thinking patterns critical for **Machine Learning**, **Deep Learning**, and **Artificial Intelligence**

Even in ML and DL, understanding algorithms, recursion, and data traversal is **crucial** when designing models, optimizing memory, and working with large datasets.

---

##  Progress

**Completed:** 30 / 100 days  
**Remaining:** 70 days to go!

Each day's work is stored in a folder named after the day, like so:

```
day 01/
    Leetcode_1(09).py
day 02/
    Leetcode_2(231).py
...
day 30/
    Leetcode_30(206).py
```

---

##  Folder Structure

Each folder contains:

- Python file with the solution to the LeetCode problem of the day
- File naming format: `Leetcode_<day number>(<problem number>).py`
- Local video recordings (not uploaded due to size)

---

##  Tools & Technologies

- Language: **Python 3**
- Platform: **LeetCode**
- IDE: **VS Code / Jupyter Notebook**

---

##  Learning Focus

This challenge covers a wide range of core DSA concepts including:

- Arrays, Strings, and Hash Maps
- Recursion and Backtracking
- Trees and Graphs (BFS, DFS, etc.)
- Dynamic Programming
- Linked Lists and Stack/Queue
- Sorting, Searching, Sliding Window, Two Pointers
- Bit Manipulation and Greedy Algorithms

These are not just theoretical concepts — they help build the thinking framework required in **AI research**, **model building**, **optimization**, and **real-world systems**.

##  Notes

- All code is written by me using **Python 3**
- This project is for my personal learning, growth, and consistency
- Anyone is welcome to fork, star, or follow along

##  Why DSA is Essential in AI/ML

You might think DSA is only for competitive programmers — but it’s also vital in **AI and Machine Learning**:

- Helps in writing **efficient data pipelines**
- Improves understanding of **computational complexity**
- Makes it easier to optimize **memory usage and runtime** in training large models
- Enables better **feature engineering** and **data manipulation**
- Crucial in designing algorithms for **recommendation systems**, **search engines**, **neural networks**, and more

##  What’s Next?

- Continue until I hit Day 100
- At Day 100, I’ll post summary statistics, insights, and a possible roadmap for:
  - System Design
  - ML Projects
  - Deep Learning & AI Research
