# 100 Days of DSA with Python

This repository contains my 100-day journey solving Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) problems using Python.  
Problems are primarily from LeetCode, and each day includes a Python solution.

## Progress

Completed: 24 / 100 days

I’m solving one DSA problem each day and organizing each solution in folders like this:

day 1/
    Leetcode_1(09).py
day 2/
    Leetcode_2(231).py
...

## Folder Structure

Each folder contains:

- Python solution to the problem of the day (.py files)
- Videos are stored locally and excluded from this repository

## Notes

- This project is for learning and consistency
- All code is written in Python 3
- File names follow this pattern: Leetcode_<day number>(<problem number>).py

## Disclaimer

This repository is for personal learning and reference.  
Please do not use it to violate any academic or contest rules.

## Stay Tuned

I’ll be updating this repository daily.  
Once I reach Day 100, I’ll publish summary stats and reflections.
